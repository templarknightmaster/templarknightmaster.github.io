				<h1>Order of the World Templar Lords</h1>
				<h2>
					Non nobis, Domine, non nobis, sed nomini Tuo da gloriam
				</h2>
				<p>
					Interested in History, interested in the ‘good old times’, don’t want to forget the medieval live and customs?
					Confused about Knighthood, want to know more about Knights and especially Templar Knights? Is your urge strong enough to learn more about the Order of the Knights of the Temple? You might be at the right website.  
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					There are many Templar groups in this world, some are huge Organisations…spread all over the globe with 100th if not 1000th of members, like the OSMTH. If you live in Europe or the USA, they are the best starting point to change your life from a peasant to a knight. Go on – contact them, show your interest and one day you will be invited and begin a life which is very much different to all other people out there.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Some others are just a group of friends, who dress up and follow the ideals of a brotherhood. Some take as member’s only men, some others also women; some keep their membership at a high level of education. Members must have a University degree and preferable a job as a leader of companies or military personnel. Again others are re-enactment groups which dresses up and parades around on town fairs.  
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					We  -  the Lords of the Templar Knights  -  keep it simple, we are a place where everyone is welcome. We evolved into a non-religious Order and as we reside in Australia – we are multicultural – meaning we make no difference between colour, language or culture of a person.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					As most of us are ‘middle class’ citizens – we talk with a plain language, we don’t have sophisticated conversations, where people try to outsmart each other, we have no secrets from each other and we have a democratic voting system, using black and white marbles.
