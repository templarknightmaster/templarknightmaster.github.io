					<p class="p-style-1">The first thing you hear, when you wake up in a Muslim country is  -  contrary to christian places, where you might hear church bells ringing  -  the Muezzin calling people to the mosque to worship Allah with their prayers. What you hear in the beginning is a 12 year old boy, taking up that task in a wonderful way. Then you will be melodically transferred to a Basar, before the fight of Templars and Saracens start. Fighting them off, the music will bring you back to a lovely song...praising God. </p>

								<h2>Krak des Chevaliers</h2>
								<p>
									The original name of the first building was Hisn al Alakrad, which means Castle of the Kurds. it was build by the Mirdasis clan around 1031 and they dispatched Kurdish soldiers to occupy it and save guard the trading routes.  In 1142 when Prince Raymond was on his way to attack Aleppo, he gave the fortress to the Order of St John. The Knights Hospitallers rebuild and extended it and named it Crac de l'Ospital. In the 1300 it was again extended to the present days size. The name Krak des Chevaliers was given in 19th century.
